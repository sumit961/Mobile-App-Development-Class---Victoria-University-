# Mobile Application Development - Class Exercises

This repository contains the class work exercises for the Mobile Application Development course at Victoria University. The exercises range from basic Kotlin syntax corrections to more advanced topics like class inheritance, loops, and data handling.

## Project Overview

This project includes 10 exercises, each focusing on different aspects of Kotlin programming and Android development. The exercises are designed to strengthen your understanding of Kotlin syntax, object-oriented programming, and basic data structures.

### File: `ex10.kt`

This file contains the solutions to exercises 1 through 10.

## Exercises

1. **Exercise 3: Error Correction**
   - Corrected syntax errors in a simple Kotlin program involving string concatenation and variable reassignment.

2. **Exercise 4: Class and Method Implementation**
   - Created a `PersonalFinanceCalculator` class with a simple method to print a greeting.

3. **Exercise 5: Data Class Creation**
   - Implemented a `Person` data class to store name and savings data.

4. **Exercise 6: Using Loops**
   - Added a `while` loop to interactively update and display the user's savings.

5. **Exercise 7: Inheritance and Abstract Classes**
   - Created an abstract `Transaction` class and two subclasses, `Income` and `Expense`, demonstrating inheritance and method overriding.

6. **Exercise 8: Mutable Lists**
   - Added functionality to save `Transaction` objects in a mutable list.

7. **Exercise 9: For-Each Loop**
   - Implemented a method to print all transactions using the `forEach` loop.

8. **Exercise 10: When Statement**
   - Utilized the `when` statement to handle user input for different transaction types and options.

## Getting Started

To run the project, simply clone this repository and open the project in Android Studio. The main Kotlin file is `ex10.kt`, where you can view and execute the code for all the exercises.

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Basic understanding of Kotlin and object-oriented programming

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mobile-app-class-exercises.git](https://github.com/sumit961/Mobile-App-Development-Class---Victoria-University-.git
